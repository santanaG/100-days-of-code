##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Git on computer, set up sublime text, learned some git commands, left off at the beginning of tribute page project on FCC

**Thoughts:** I am in serious need of refreshers on HTML and CSS. Eloquent JS site went down for some reason. Has not gone back up since. Wanted to use it to refresh on JS. Will do so when I begin JS/Jquery on FCC

### Day 2: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through and refreshed a lot of FCCs HTML/CSS. Began Tribute page project. Have read up on a lot of things. had to go back and refresh on Git again, keep forgetting stuff.

**Thoughts:** I will start a book on Git and see how I do. Will attempt to set up a workflow so that I can quickly save all of my work. Still need to learn how to push changes and the like. Need a book and lots of practice on CSS. I want to understand CSS as well as I can before moving on to Bootstrap and other CSS related libraries.

### Day 3: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
 - 30 minutes watching others code - Check
 - 1 hour coding projects - Check
 - 1 hour learning what I need to code projects - Check
 - 1 hour reading about a concept I wish to understand - Check

**Thoughts:** Ive gotten along well with CSS and HTML. I will attempt to add 1 random webpage to recreate every few days to my list of things to do. The goal being to REALLY get HTML/CSS down. I will attempt to do this WITHOUT bootstrap or JS. If I feel it is too much work I will alternate between HTML/CSS ONLY and HTML/CSS/BS/JS/Etc.

### Day 4: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
 - 30 minutes watching others code
 - 1 hour coding projects
 - 1 hour learning what I need to code projects

**Thoughts:** I did not get as much done as I would have liked. I believe today will be a better day for this. I will now actually start writing down with a lot more detail what I am doing instead of confirming that I have reached some of my goals for the day.

### Day 5: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
 - Read up to page 113 in current book
 - Finished Tribute Page
 	 - Added window div and removed scroll bars
	 - resized images and added some padding to fit images inside 400px area
	 - Achor linked year to pictures in order to have window div always show the picture relevant to the year clicked
	 	 - Settled on blue to black and bold for link styling on link to hover
		 - PROBLEM
		   - Cannot get div to remain a certain size in relation to the rest of the page once width gets under 580px or so
			 - I have given up on the problem and will revisit it in the future, once I get more experience with CSS
			 - I am sure media queries would resolve the issue but I feel there are more organic ways to resolve this
		 - Was unable to get a way for link hover to translate into visited link
 - Watched [funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HfAdeoq97k)

**Thoughts:** I definitely want to come back and visit the tribute page with just CSS/HTML idea once I have a lot more experience. It is not perfect and there were a few things that required more than I could bite but I definitely learned a bit about limitations and constraints in simple HTML/CSS. I am now ready for Bootstrap and other frameworks. I hope they save me a crap-ton of time!
