**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Git on computer, set up sublime text, learned some git commands, left off at the beginning of tribute page project on FCC

**Thoughts:** I am in serious need of refreshers on HTML and CSS. Eloquent JS site went down for some reason. Has not gone back up since. Wanted to use it to refresh on JS. Will do so when I begin JS/Jquery on FCC

### Day 2: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through and refreshed a lot of FCCs HTML/CSS. Began Tribute page project. Have read up on a lot of things. had to go back and refresh on Git again, keep forgetting stuff.

**Thoughts:** I will start a book on Git and see how I do. Will attempt to set up a workflow so that I can quickly save all of my work. Still need to learn how to push changes and the like. Need a book and lots of practice on CSS. I want to understand CSS as well as I can before moving on to Bootstrap and other CSS related libraries.

**Today's Progress**: 
 - 30 minutes watching others code - Check

 - 1 hour learning what I need to code projects - Check

**Thoughts:** Ive gotten along well with CSS and HTML. I will attempt to add 1 random webpage to recreate every few days to my list of things to do. The goal being to REALLY get HTML/CSS down. I will attempt to do this WITHOUT bootstrap or JS. If I feel it is too much work I will alternate between HTML/CSS ONLY and HTML/CSS/BS/JS/Etc.
