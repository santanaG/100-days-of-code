### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 10: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Worked on portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I am almost done with this! I feel I have definitely learned a great deal of CSS and HTML. Using frameworks like materialize make it easier to code but at least for me, it has made it TONS easier to look at a particular element that is not behaving as expected and poking at it till it does. Chrome Dev tools is also up there in terms of helpfulness. I love the color coding for elements in particular.

### Day 8: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Read up on design concepts
 - Read up on Material Design
 - Read through [materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) documentation

**Thoughts:** I do not understand [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). In turn this means I do not understand [materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/). I have spent hours messing around with CSS just to figure out that when it comes time to actually produce, I cannot. I signed up for the long run though so tomorrow I will dig further.

### Day 7: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Completed [Try jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)

**Thoughts:** I had a very distracting week away from my work since I last checked in. I at least finished up Try jQuery though. I am now going to start moving away from codepen as my go to coding place and get a proper development environment going. To that, I have git shell installed and its using powershell on my windows PC, I have sublime as my text editor of choice and I am not sure what else I need. I would imagine chrome dev tools is all I need for now in terms of debugging and the like. Any other considerations I will have to look up. I have not read a single book since I last posted.

### Day 6: January 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Made small adjustment to Tribute page to accomodate missed user story requirement
 - Signed up to Javascript30 and will start ASAP
 - Finished FCC Responsive Design with Bootstrap
 - Finished FCC jQuery
 - Read up on Javascript Closures
 - Read up on Javascript pattern The Module
 - Read up on Javascript pattern Currying
 - Read up on JCanvas
 - Read up on JQuery

**Thoughts:** Though my coding was at a minimal, I learned a lot and feel like tomorrow will be a very productive day. Understanding jQuery loads better than my first time attempting to go through this course. I will definitely use it and Bootstrap to finish my portfolio project now. I also need to get back and finish reading HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites.

### Day 5: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Read up to page 113 in current book
 - Finished Tribute Page
 	 - Added window div and removed scroll bars
	 - resized images and added some padding to fit images inside 400px area
	 - Achor linked year to pictures in order to have window div always show the picture relevant to the year clicked
	 - Settled on blue to black and bold for link styling on link to hover
	 - PROBLEM
	   - Cannot get div to remain a certain size in relation to the rest of the page once width gets under 580px or so
		 - I have given up on the problem and will revisit it in the future, once I get more experience with CSS
		 - I am sure media queries would resolve the issue but I feel there are more organic ways to resolve this
	 - Was unable to get a way for link hover to translate into visited link
 - Watched [funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HfAdeoq97k)

**Thoughts:** I definitely want to come back and visit the tribute page with just CSS/HTML idea once I have a lot more experience. It is not perfect and there were a few things that required more than I could bite but I definitely learned a bit about limitations and constraints in simple HTML/CSS. I am now ready for Bootstrap and other frameworks. I hope they save me a crap-ton of time!

### Day 4: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - 30 minutes watching others code
 - 1 hour coding projects
 - 1 hour learning what I need to code projects

**Thoughts:** I did not get as much done as I would have liked. I believe today will be a better day for this. I will now actually start writing down with a lot more detail what I am doing instead of confirming that I have reached some of my goals for the day.

### Day 3: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
 - 30 minutes watching others code - Check
 - 1 hour coding projects - Check
 - 1 hour learning what I need to code projects - Check
 - 1 hour reading about a concept I wish to understand - Check

**Thoughts:** Ive gotten along well with CSS and HTML. I will attempt to add 1 random webpage to recreate every few days to my list of things to do. The goal being to REALLY get HTML/CSS down. I will attempt to do this WITHOUT bootstrap or JS. If I feel it is too much work I will alternate between HTML/CSS ONLY and HTML/CSS/BS/JS/Etc.

### Day 2: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Went through and refreshed a lot of FCCs HTML/CSS. Began Tribute page project. Have read up on a lot of things. had to go back and refresh on Git again, keep forgetting stuff.

**Thoughts:** I will start a book on Git and see how I do. Will attempt to set up a workflow so that I can quickly save all of my work. Still need to learn how to push changes and the like. Need a book and lots of practice on CSS. I want to understand CSS as well as I can before moving on to Bootstrap and other CSS related libraries.

### Day 1: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Set up Git on computer, set up sublime text, learned some git commands, left off at the beginning of tribute page project on FCC

**Thoughts:** I am in serious need of refreshers on HTML and CSS. Eloquent JS site went down for some reason. Has not gone back up since. Wanted to use it to refresh on JS. Will do so when I begin JS/Jquery on FCC
